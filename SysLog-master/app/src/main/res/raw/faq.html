<h4>Why does SysLog need root access?</h4>
<p>
Starting with Android 4.1, the system logs were restricted to system applications only.<br />
You can <a href="https://github.com/Tortel/SysLog/blob/master/Readme.md#enabling-log-access-via-adb-no-root-required">manually enable access</a> to some logs using adb though.

</p>

<h4>Why is the last kernel log grayed out?</h4>
<p>
Your device's kernel needs to support the last log feature, and SysLog checks for the '/proc/last_kmsg' file at start. 
Even if your kernel supports the feature, it may only save the log during a kernel crash. Check for more details with 
the maintainer of the kernel/ROM you use.

<h4>What is Grep?</h4>
<p>
Grep is a Unix utility to match lines based on regular expressions. If you are not familiar with it, I would not 
recommend using it. For more details, check the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html">help page</a>.

<h4>What information gets scrubbed?</h4>
<p>
    The scrubber uses a set of regular expressions to scrub out email addresses, phone numbers, URLs, IP addresses,
    serial number, and some basic phone and user information. For more details, you can view
    <a href="https://github.com/Tortel/SysLog/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/tortel/syslog/utils/ScrubberUtils.java">the source</a>.
